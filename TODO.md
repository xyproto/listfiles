## Plans

- [ ] Try to show all relevant info on one screen, then let the user choose to see more details, see more or perform an action.
- [ ] Also support symlinks.
- [ ] Files in ~/vid should not be "Go-style Assembly".
- [ ] Draw a nice user interface with perhaps a blue background.
- [ ] Present actions that the user can do, such as:
  - [ ] Use Ollama to find the most likely way to build this project, then iterate and fix errors and install packages as needed.
  - [ ] Create a file.
  - [ ] Edit a file with the most likely program.
  - [ ] Delete a file.
  - [ ] Create a directory.
  - [ ] View a file.
  - [ ] Move a file.
